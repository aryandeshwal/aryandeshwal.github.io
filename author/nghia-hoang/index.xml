      <description>&lt;p&gt;We received the information about the workshop date from AAAI. The workshop will be held on Monday, February 26th, 2024. The timings of the workshop are from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM PST and include a 1-hour break from 1:00 PM â€“ 2:00 PM. The talk will be 30 minutes with time for a few questions from the audience. Please let us know if you prefer to give your talk in the morning or in the afternoon (after 2:00 PM) session?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the information about workshop registration is available here: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/registration/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/registration/&lt;/a&gt;. Please let me know if you have any questions about the registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be really grateful if you could attend the workshop in-person. It will be a great opportunity for us to discuss your work and ideas outside the talk as well. However, if you prefer a virtual talk, please let me know so that I can manage the virtual setup before the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you
Aryan&lt;/p&gt;
